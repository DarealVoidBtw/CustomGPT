Hello Thanks for reading this project has been one thats very important to me and it been mainly stressful and frustrating to bring to life and has taken many months and while its not winning any smartness award I believe that it's a step in the right direction and now it's built I can intergrate it into anything I want or just talk to it and get nice responses I will continue to improve the code not to try make it smarter but just to clean it up and make it more efficent so that I can show it off to people I work with and my peers I hope you can learn from the code as I have while building I will try make understandable notes in my code in the future so you can understand each part and get to grips with how Ai's work or if you already know please give me feedback on how I can make it more efficeient or make the Ai itself smarter as I would love to hear what you have to say!
